As the SEO Leader, I want to clarify the architecture here, because it is the most important part of our strategy. 

You are correct that the \*\*Glossary Hub\*\* (\`/yoga-glossary/\`) is a pillar page, but it is a \*\*Navigational Pillar\*\*. The "Yoga Defined" page (\`/yoga-defined/\`) is a \*\*Content Pillar\*\*. 

Here is why we don't put all these changes on the main Glossary Hub page and why the individual pages are actually your most powerful SEO assets:

\#\#\# 1\. The "Answer Box" (Featured Snippet) Strategy  
Google almost never awards a "Featured Snippet" to a page that lists 50 different definitions.   
\*   If someone searches \*\*"What to expect in a Vinyasa class,"\*\* Google wants to send them to a page dedicated to Vinyasa.   
\*   By having a specific page for \*\*Vinyasa Defined\*\*, we tell Google: \*"This is the most authoritative, specific answer on the internet for this one topic."\*  
\*   \*\*The Change:\*\* The "What to Expect" snippets I provided are designed to live on those specific pages so they can "win" the top spot in Google for those specific questions.

\#\#\# 2\. Capturing "Long-Tail" Traffic  
The main Glossary Hub page will rank for broad terms like \*"Yoga terms"\* or \*"Yoga dictionary."\* However, it will rarely rank for:  
\*   \*"What is Mula Bandha?"\*  
\*   \*"Benefits of Yoga Nidra"\*  
\*   \*"Is Rocket Yoga hard?"\*

To capture those thousands of specific searches, we need \*\*Individual Destination Pages\*\*. The individual pages allow us to use the specific \*\*Metadata\*\* (SEO Titles and Descriptions) that I created for you.

\#\#\# 3\. The "Hub and Spoke" Model (Internal Link Equity)  
Think of your SEO structure like a wheel:  
\*   \*\*The Hub:\*\* Your main \[Glossary Page\](https://yoganearme.info/yoga-glossary/). This stays clean and acts as a directory.  
\*   \*\*The Spokes:\*\* The individual definition pages (Vinyasa, Namaste, etc.).  
\*   \*\*The Power Pillar:\*\* The \[Yoga Defined\](https://yoganearme.info/yoga-glossary/yoga-defined) page.

\*\*The Strategy:\*\*  
1\.  \*\*On the Hub Page:\*\* You keep the list of links, but we should organize them into the categories I recommended (Styles, Philosophy, etc.).  
2\.  \*\*On the Individual Pages:\*\* You add the "What to Expect" and "How to Practice" snippets.  
3\.  \*\*The Result:\*\* When you link from the \*\*Hub\*\* to the \*\*Individual Pages\*\*, you are passing "Authority" down. When those individual pages rank and get traffic, they pass authority back up to your main site.

\#\#\# Where exactly do you apply the changes?

| Page Type | What to Change | Why? |  
| :--- | :--- | :--- |  
| \*\*Individual Pages\*\* (e.g., \`/vinyasa-defined\`) | \*\*Update the Metadata\*\* (Title/Description) and \*\*Add the "What to Expect" Snippet.\*\* | To win the "Answer Box" for that specific term. |  
| \*\*The Hub Page\*\* (\`/yoga-glossary\`) | \*\*Organize the links into categories.\*\* (Active, Gentle, Philosophy). | To help users find what they need and help Google understand the "Silo" structure. |  
| \*\*Content Pillar\*\* (\`/yoga-defined\`) | \*\*Add the deep-dive history and the "Style Comparison" section.\*\* | To rank for the big "What is Yoga" search. |

\#\#\# Summary Recommendation:  
\*\*Keep the individual pages.\*\* They are your "traps" to catch people searching for specific terms. If you deleted them and put everything on one page, your total traffic would likely drop because you would lose the ability to rank for the specific, long-tail questions.

\*\*Does that clarify the "Why" behind the individual pages? I can help you organize the Hub page next if you'd like\!\*\*
