- **Mindfulness & Presence:** Instead of a "workout," the focus is on a "work-in"—noticing physical sensations and keeping the mind anchored in the present moment.
- **Accessible & Non-Competitive:** These classes prioritize comfort over complexity; the goal is to feel better, not to "master" a difficult posture.
