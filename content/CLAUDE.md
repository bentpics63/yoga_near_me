## Quality Standards

### The Lisa Test (Practice Content)
Would Lisa Marie say this to a private student? If it sounds like marketing copy, generic wellness content, or trying too hard — revise toward sincerity, precision, and genuine invitation.

### The Eddie Test (Business Content)
1. Is there data?
2. Is the action clear?
3. Is the ROI visible?
4. Is the tone peer-level (not talking down)?
5. Is it free of consultant-speak?

### Universal Standards
- Never oversell — be honest about what yoga can and can't do
- Never use pseudoscience — if you can't cite it, caveat it
- Never gatekeep — make everything accessible to beginners
- Never use generic wellness buzzwords ("detoxify," "cleanse," "transform your life")
- Always prioritize practitioners — everything should genuinely help

---

## Vocabulary Rules

### Lisa Marie Content — Always Use:
- "Practice" (not "workout")
- "Teacher" (not "instructor")
- "Student" (not "client")

### Lisa Marie Content — Never Use:
- Fitness industry language ("activate," "optimize," "burn")
- Wellness buzzwords ("detoxify," "cleanse," "wellness journey")
- Overselling ("transform your entire life")
- Pseudoscience without qualification

### Eddie Content — Always Use:
- Specific numbers and data
- Action verbs ("implement," "optimize," "analyze")
- Peer-level language
