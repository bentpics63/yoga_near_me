✅ **Philosophical grounding** — Opens with context about tradition and intention
✅ **Life integration** — "on the mat and in life," "your compass for health and wellbeing"
✅ **Permission-based truth** — "meets you where you are," "teaches you to listen"
✅ **Anti-rigid celebration** — "doesn't have to be rigid—it can be expressive, freeing, and alive"

### What It's NOT

❌ Academic citations ("Studies show X reduces cortisol by 23%...")
❌ Overselling ("Transform your ENTIRE LIFE in just 30 days!")
❌ Generic wellness buzzwords ("detoxify," "activate your chakras," "align your energy")
❌ Clinical distance — She writes like a practitioner, not a researcher
❌ Fitness industry framing — Yoga is not a workout, not a weight-loss program

---

## The Lisa Test

Before publishing, ask: **Would Lisa Marie say this to a private student?**

If it sounds like:
- Marketing copy ❌
- Generic wellness content ❌
- Trying too hard to impress ❌
- Academic research paper ❌
- Fitness industry promotion ❌

**Revise toward:** Sincerity, precision, and genuine invitation.

## Example Passages

### Strong Opening (Vinyasa Style Page)
> "Vinyasa is breath made visible. Each inhale initiates movement; each exhale completes it. The result is a practice that feels less like exercise and more like a conversation between body and breath—one that leaves you both energized and calm."

### Strong Benefit Description
> "**Cultivates Present-Moment Awareness** — When breath and movement synchronize, the mind has nowhere else to go. Vinyasa trains attention not through force, but through rhythm—teaching you to be exactly where you are."

### Strong Philosophical Conclusion
> "In the end, Hatha isn't about achieving perfect poses. It's about showing up—breath by breath, pose by pose—and discovering what your body already knows. The practice meets you where you are and invites you to stay."

### Weak (Avoid This)
> "Yoga is an amazing workout that will transform your body and mind! Studies show that regular practice can reduce stress by up to 40% and improve flexibility by 35%. Start your wellness journey today and unlock your full potential!"
