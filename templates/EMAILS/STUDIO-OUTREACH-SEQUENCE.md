## Pre-Outreach Checklist

Before emailing a studio:
1. ✅ Their listing exists on YogaNearMe
2. ✅ You've researched their intro offer (from their website)
3. ✅ You've pre-filled the intro offer on their listing
4. ✅ Visibility Snapshot PDF is ready (optional but powerful)

## EMAIL 1: THE GIFT (No Ask)

**Send:** Day 0
**Subject Options:**
- Your studio's YogaNearMe visibility report
- [Studio Name] is now on YogaNearMe
- Your free listing is live

**Best Subject:** `Your studio's YogaNearMe visibility report`

---

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

We've built a listing page for [Studio Name] on YogaNearMe.info.

Here's the link: [Listing URL]

YogaNearMe is a yoga studio directory focused on helping independent studios compete with ClassPass and the big aggregators. We have 30,000+ listings and growing traffic from students searching "yoga near me."

Your studio is already appearing in local search results. No action needed on your end—just wanted you to know you're listed.

If anything looks off (wrong address, outdated hours), you can claim the listing and update it yourself: [Claim URL]

— Eddie
YogaNearMe.info

P.S. Attached is a quick visibility snapshot showing how your listing appears to students. [Attach PDF if using]
```

**Key Points:**
- No ask in this email
- Pure value/gift
- Establishes we've already invested in them
- Low-key CTA only if something's wrong

---

## EMAIL 2: THE OPPORTUNITY (Day 3)

**Send:** 3 days after Email 1
**Subject Options:**
- We found your intro offer
- Quick question about [Studio Name]
- Your intro offer is ready to go live

**Best Subject:** `We found your intro offer`

---

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

I noticed on your website that you offer [Specific Intro Offer from their site].

We've pre-filled this on your YogaNearMe listing so students searching in [City] can see it right away.

To make it live, just claim your listing (takes about 60 seconds):
[Claim URL]

Once claimed, you can:
- Edit your intro offer anytime
- Add photos of your space
- Update your hours and class schedule
- Start receiving student inquiries directly

Studios with active intro offers get 3x more clicks than those without. Yours is ready—just needs your approval.

— Eddie

P.S. Claiming is free. We don't charge for listings.
```

**Key Points:**
- Shows you did the research (specific offer)
- Removes their work (pre-filled)
- Clear value proposition
- Addresses cost concern proactively

## EMAIL 3: SOCIAL PROOF (Day 7)

**Send:** 7 days after Email 1 (4 days after Email 2)
**Subject Options:**
- [X] [City] studios claimed this week
- Other studios in your area are getting found
- Quick update on your listing

**Best Subject:** `[X] [City] studios claimed this week`

---

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

Quick update: [X] yoga studios in [City/Region] claimed their YogaNearMe listings this week.

[Studio A] and [Studio B] in your area went live yesterday and are already receiving student inquiries.

Your listing for [Studio Name] is still unclaimed. The intro offer we found ("[Intro Offer]") is pre-filled and ready.

Claim in 60 seconds: [Claim URL]

If you'd rather we remove your listing entirely, just reply and let me know. No hard feelings.

— Eddie

P.S. Studios that claim see an average of [X] profile views in their first month. Just from students searching "yoga near me."
```

**Key Points:**
- Social proof (others are doing it)
- Specific names if possible (or general "[X] studios")
- Easy out (removes pressure, builds trust)
- Data point on value
