# Photo Optimizer — Product Exploration

**Status:** Exploration (Not yet in development)
**Source:** Claude.ai conversation notes (Jan 2026)
**Bundle:** Growth Suite ($99/mo)

---

## Concept

Help yoga studios improve their visual presence with AI-powered photo analysis and optimization.

**Problem:** Studios often have poor quality photos that hurt their Google/directory listings. They don't know what makes a good studio photo or how to improve.

**Solution:** Automated photo analysis + actionable recommendations + one-click fixes.

## Potential Features

### Analysis
- Quality scoring (lighting, composition, resolution)
- Relevance check (is this actually a yoga studio photo?)
- Diversity audit (do you have photos of: studio space, classes in action, teachers, amenities?)
- Competitor comparison (how do your photos compare to nearby studios?)

### Recommendations
- "Your main photo is too dark. Here's how to brighten it."
- "You're missing class-in-action photos. These get 2x more clicks."
- "Your photo has text overlay—Google prefers clean images."

### Automation
- Image compression (lossless, 60-70% size reduction)
- Auto-cropping for different platforms (GBP, Instagram, website)
- ALT text generation for SEO
- WebP conversion with fallback
- One-click upload to GBP

---

## Why This Matters

- Studios with 10+ photos get 35% more clicks on Google
- Visual quality directly impacts first impressions
- Most studio owners aren't photographers and need guidance

---

## Technical Considerations

- AI/ML for image analysis (Google Vision API, custom model, or third-party)
- Integration with GBP for direct upload
- Storage for before/after comparisons
- Possible white-label of existing photo optimization tools

---

## Open Questions

1. Build vs. buy? (Existing tools: TinyPNG, ImageOptim, Cloudinary)
2. How much AI analysis vs. simple checklist?
3. Standalone product or always bundled?
4. Integration with booking platform photo uploads?

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Validate demand with 10 studio owner interviews
- [ ] Research existing photo optimization tools for white-label
- [ ] Define MVP feature set
- [ ] Estimate build time and cost
