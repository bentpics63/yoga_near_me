# Market Requirements Document (MRD) v1.0

**Product:** YogaNearMe Studio Visibility Report
**Date:** January 24, 2026
**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Draft
**Purpose:** Trust-building lead magnet for studio owner acquisition

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**Product:** Free instant visibility audit that shows yoga studio owners exactly how they appear online—and what's broken.

**Vision:** Give studio owners immediate, tangible value before asking for anything. Demonstrate that YogaNearMe understands their real problem (being found) and can help solve it.

**Primary Outcome:** Trust. Studios see us as experts, not just another directory asking for their listing.

**Secondary Outcome:** Qualified leads. Every audit creates a natural path to claiming/upgrading their YogaNearMe listing.

**Strategic Role:** First touch in the Studio Suite funnel. The report proves value → claim listing → Schedule Connect → AI Receptionist → Retention Module.

---

## 2. Why This Product First

### The Trust Problem

Studio owners are burned out on directories. They've been:
- Spammed by Yelp sales reps
- Exploited by ClassPass margins (15-50%)
- Promised traffic that never materialized
- Asked to pay for "premium listings" with no ROI proof

**Result:** Deep skepticism toward any platform asking them to engage.

### The Solution: Give Before Asking

The Visibility Report inverts the relationship:
- **Free** — no trial, no credit card, no strings
- **Immediate** — results in 30 seconds, not "we'll email you"
- **Actionable** — shows specific problems with specific fixes
- **Expert** — positions YogaNearMe as the authority on being found

### Why SEO/Visibility (Not Something Else)

| Alternative | Why Not First |
|-------------|---------------|
| AI Receptionist demo | Too complex for first impression; requires commitment |
| Photo optimizer | Useful but not urgent; doesn't create "aha" moment |
| Review aggregator | Valuable but passive; doesn't show expertise |
| Competitor intel | Feels like spying; creates discomfort |
| **Visibility Report** | **Immediate pain point + expertise demonstration + natural funnel** |

---

## 3. Market Context

### The Landscape

**89%** of consumers research local businesses online before visiting.
**76%** of people who search for local businesses visit within 24 hours.
**Source:** [Solitude Marketing](https://solitudemarketing.com/articles/pilates-and-yoga-studio-marketing-tactics-that-work-in-2025/)

Studios know they need better Google presence but:
- Don't know how to check what's wrong
- Can't afford $200-500/month local SEO tools
- Get conflicting advice from "experts"
- Don't have time to figure it out

### Competitive Tools (and Why We Win)

| Tool | Price | Problem for Studios |
|------|-------|---------------------|
| BrightLocal | $20-40/month | Still costs money; not yoga-specific |
| Moz Local | $74+/month | Expensive; overwhelming for non-technical |
| Semrush Local | $139+/month | Way too complex; enterprise-focused |
| SE Ranking | $65+/month | Requires learning curve |
| Generic free audits | Free | Not yoga-specific; no follow-up value |

**Our Positioning:**
- **Free forever** (report itself)
- **Yoga-specific** (we know what matters for studios)
- **Instant** (30 seconds, not email-your-results-in-24-hours)
- **Integrated** (natural path to claiming listing, then receptionist)

### Proven Model

Free SEO audits are a validated lead generation strategy:
- [SEOptimer](https://www.seoptimer.com/) reports 2000+ agencies using embeddable audits
- [MySiteAuditor](https://mysiteauditor.com/) built a business on white-label audit widgets
- Agencies report **65%+ conversion** from free audit to paid services
- Cost per lead can be as low as **$0.49** vs industry average of $30-50

## 4. ICP and Anti-ICP

### Ideal Customer Profile

**Primary:** Studio owner/manager who:
- Runs 1-3 location yoga studio
- Knows they should "do better on Google" but doesn't know how
- Has been burned by marketing vendors before
- Values teaching over marketing (resentful of needing to market)
- Would pay for done-for-them solutions if they trusted the provider

**Secondary:** New studio owners who:
- Just opened or are about to open
- Need to build online presence from scratch
- Are actively searching for guidance
- Haven't been burned yet (more open to platforms)

### Anti-ICP

- **Franchise/chain studios:** Have corporate marketing; don't need us
- **Studios with in-house marketing:** Already know their visibility; won't value the report
- **"I don't care about online" owners:** Won't engage regardless
- **Studios planning to close:** No long-term value

---

## 9. Marketing Strategy

### Channel 1: Existing Listings (Primary)

**30,000 studios already in our database.**

- Add "Check Visibility" CTA to every listing page
- Email campaign to unclaimed listings: "We checked your visibility..."
- Include score preview in claim encouragement emails

**Target:** 5% of unclaimed listings run audit = 1,500 audits → 15% claim = 225 new claims

### Channel 2: Search/SEO

Landing page optimized for:
- "yoga studio SEO"
- "how to get more students yoga"
- "yoga studio Google ranking"
- "local SEO yoga studio"

**Target:** 500 organic visits/month → 100 audits → 15 claims

### Channel 3: Social/Content

- Instagram/FB: "Is your studio invisible on Google? Free 30-second check"
- Blog posts: "5 reasons your yoga studio isn't showing up in search"
- Partner with yoga teacher training programs (value-add for graduates)

### Channel 4: Outreach

- Direct email to studios with low scores (we can pre-generate)
- "We noticed [STUDIO] isn't showing up well in [CITY] yoga searches..."
- Position as helpful tip, not sales pitch

## 11. Pricing & Product Expansion

### Phase 1: Free Report (Lead Magnet)

**The initial report is FREE. Always.**

This captures attention and builds trust. The funnel:

2. **Free claim** → gets studio into ecosystem
3. **Free Schedule Connect** → proves value
4. **Paid products** → when trust is established

### Phase 2: Visibility Optimizer (Paid Tiers)

Once the free report proves product-market fit, expand to paid automation tiers:

| Tier | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|

## 12. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Google Places API changes | Low | High | Build with abstraction layer; have fallback scoring |
| Studios don't care about score | Medium | High | Focus on specific actionable items, not just number |
| Competitor copies feature | High | Low | We have 30K listings; they don't |
| Low conversion to claim | Medium | Medium | A/B test CTAs; follow-up email sequence |
| Audit feels salesy | Medium | High | Lead with genuine value; make CTA soft |

---

## 13. V1 Scope

### In Scope

- Single studio audit (by URL or name search)
- Google Business Profile checks
- Basic website checks (speed, mobile, HTTPS)
- YogaNearMe listing status
- Competitor comparison (3-5 nearby)
- Email capture for full report
- CTA to claim listing

### Out of Scope (V2+)

- Social media presence audit
- Review response suggestions
- Automated fix implementation
- Ongoing monitoring/alerts
- White-label for yoga associations
- Historical score tracking

---

## 14. Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Deliverable |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Design | 1 week | Report UI mockups, scoring algorithm |
| Build | 2 weeks | Working MVP with all data sources |
| Test | 1 week | QA, edge cases, performance |
| Soft Launch | 1 week | 100 studios, gather feedback |
| Full Launch | Ongoing | Deploy to all listings + marketing |

**Target launch:** 5 weeks from approval

---

## 15. Open Questions

1. **Email required?** Do we require email to see full report, or show full report and offer email for PDF?
2. **Score algorithm weights:** How much weight for each factor? Need to validate with real data.
3. **Competitor visibility:** Show competitor names, or just "Studio A, Studio B"?
4. **Pre-generation:** Should we pre-generate reports for all 30K studios to enable proactive outreach?
5. **Partner access:** Should yoga teacher trainings get bulk audit access for their graduates?

---

## Appendix A: Competitive Audit Examples

- [SEOptimer Free Audit](https://www.seoptimer.com/)
- [BrightLocal Free Check](https://www.brightlocal.com/local-search-results-checker/)
- [Moz Local Check](https://moz.com/local)

These are generic. None are yoga-specific. None integrate with a directory. None lead to a receptionist product.
