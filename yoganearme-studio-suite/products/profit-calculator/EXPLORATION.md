**Status:** Exploration (Not yet in development)
**Source:** Claude.ai conversation notes (Jan 2026)
**Bundle:** Growth Suite ($99/mo)

## Concept

Help studio owners understand their business economics and make smarter pricing/capacity decisions.

**Problem:** Many studio owners don't know their true cost per class, breakeven point, or whether their pricing is competitive. They make gut decisions instead of data-driven ones.

**Solution:** Calculator that takes their numbers and shows profitability, benchmarks, and optimization opportunities.

## Potential Features

### Cost Analysis
- Input: rent, utilities, teacher pay, insurance, marketing spend
- Output: cost per class, cost per student, breakeven attendance
- Visualization: "You need 8 students per class to break even"

### Revenue Modeling
- Current: drop-in, class packs, unlimited membership breakdown
- What-if scenarios: "If you raised prices 10%..."
- Seasonality adjustments

### Pricing Optimization
- Compare to local competitors (from YogaNearMe data)
- Suggested price ranges by class type
- Drop-in vs. membership value analysis
- Intro offer ROI calculator

### Marketing ROI
- Input: marketing spend, new student acquisition
- Output: customer acquisition cost, lifetime value
- Recommendation: "You're spending $X per new student. Top studios spend $Y."

### Capacity Planning
- Class utilization rates
- Peak vs. off-peak analysis
- Add class recommendations
- Teacher scheduling optimization

## Why This Matters

- Studios that understand their numbers make better decisions
- Most studio owners are teachers first, business people second
- Simple tools don't exist—spreadsheets are intimidating
- Creates stickiness with YogaNearMe platform

## Data Sources

| Data | Source |
|------|--------|
| Competitor pricing | YogaNearMe directory |
| Industry benchmarks | Aggregated from studios using tool |
| Studio-specific | User input |
| Attendance data | MindBody/WellnessLiving integration (Phase 2) |

---

## Technical Considerations

- Simple calculator can be built quickly (client-side only)
- Advanced features need studio data integration
- Privacy considerations for sharing financial data
- Benchmarking requires aggregated, anonymized data

---

## Competitive Landscape

| Tool | Notes |
|------|-------|
| MindBody Reports | Built into platform, but complex |
| Square Analytics | For Square users only |
| Generic spreadsheets | Not yoga-specific |
| Fitness business consultants | Expensive, not self-service |

**Our angle:** Simple, yoga-specific, integrated with directory data for benchmarks

---

## Open Questions

1. How much studio data are owners willing to input?
2. Can we get enough data for meaningful benchmarks?
3. Integration with booking platforms worth the effort?
4. Standalone free tool or bundled?

---

## MVP Concept

Start with a simple, free calculator:
1. Enter: monthly rent, classes per month, avg attendance, avg price
2. Output: cost per class, revenue per class, profit margin, breakeven
3. CTA: "Want more insights? Connect your MindBody account."

This could be a lead magnet like the Visibility Report.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Validate demand with 10 studio owner interviews
- [ ] Build simple free calculator MVP
- [ ] Gather data to create benchmarks
- [ ] Define paid tier features
