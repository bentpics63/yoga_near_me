# YogaNearMe Studio Suite

Product documentation for YogaNearMe's Virtual Marketing Department — an AI-powered marketing system for yoga studio owners.

---

## The Virtual Marketing Department

**Vision:** Make every yoga studio owner feel like they have a full-time marketing person on staff.

**Core Insight:** Studio owners are "reluctant marketers" — they opened a studio to teach, not to manage SEO. We give them back time to teach.

**Architecture:** Co-Pilot (AI-first orchestration that monitors, alerts, suggests, and executes)

- [**Master MRD**](VIRTUAL-MARKETING-DEPARTMENT-MRD.md) — Strategy, positioning, pricing, build order
