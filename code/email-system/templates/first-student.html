<!-- Email 4: First Student -->

  Wanted to share something we heard last week.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; color: #2C3E3A; margin: 0 0 16px 0;">
  A studio owner in {{nearby_city}} told us a new student came in and said, "I found you on YogaNearMe—your intro offer got me in the door."
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; color: #2C3E3A; margin: 0 0 16px 0;">
  <strong>That's the entire point.</strong>

  We're not building another Yelp where you pay to avoid being buried. We're not Mindbody trying to own your student relationships. We're a directory that does one job: help students find studios they'll actually return to.

  You're part of that now.

  A few studios have asked what they can do to get more visibility. The honest answer:
</p>

<ol style="font-size: 16px; color: #2C3E3A; margin: 0 0 24px 0; padding-left: 24px;">
  <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;"><strong>Complete your profile.</strong> Photos, intro offer, vibe tags. Students filter by these.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;"><strong>Keep your hours current.</strong> Nothing loses trust faster than a student showing up to a closed door.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Ask happy students to leave a Google review.</strong> We pull those ratings automatically.</li>
</ol>

<p style="font-size: 16px; color: #2C3E3A; margin: 0 0 24px 0;">
  That's it. No algorithm to game. No ads to buy.
